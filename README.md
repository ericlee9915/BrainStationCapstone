# BrainStationCapstone

This Capstone project includes Risk Assessment, STRIDE Threat Modeling, Network Architecture, Third-Party Risk, Incident Response Plan, and Business Continuity Plan for an organization called MAISON.
The attached file is the presentation I prepared to showcase my analysis and evaluation of the organization's current security posture. 
From this analysis, I was able to create suggestions and recommendations to improve the overall security to protect the organization's assets.
